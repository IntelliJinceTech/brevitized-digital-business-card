## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

In this mini project, I used React and CRA as well as the CSS to make a more on-the-go version of my resume. As an engineer and product manager, I love finding ways to save time and solve problems. Especially so - for myself. As I didn't have a great way of showcasing my experience and skillset in a portable way while attending Meetups and conferences, while also not carrying a stack of business cards - I created this project in that regard.

## Optimizations
In the future, I will be moving from Create React App to Vite so that my development speed and efficiency will be faster. In terms of the content itself, that will always be an iterative process as I will hope to improve every day. 

## Lessons Learned:

Styling components with regular CSS was new to me and so this project was an exercise in itself to improve my CSS skills. The utilization of descendent selectors really helped in this project.
